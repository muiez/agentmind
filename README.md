## Why agentmind?

Every AI agent needs a conscience - memory to remember, beliefs to guide decisions, reflection to improve, and ethics to stay aligned. Today, developers hack together vector DBs, prompt engineering, and custom storage. We make it simple.

```python
from agentmind import Memory

# Initialize memory for your AI assistant with session tracking
memory = Memory(local_mode=True, session_id="chat_001")

# Store different types of data during conversation
memory.remember("I prefer morning meetings")
memory.remember("My current project deadline is March 15th")
memory.remember({
    "preferences": {
        "communication_style": "direct and concise",
        "meeting_times": ["9am", "2pm"],
        "timezone": "EST"
    }
})

# Later when you need context...
context = memory.recall("meeting preferences")
# Returns: ["I prefer morning meetings", {"preferences": {"meeting_times": ["9am", "2pm"], ...}}]

context = memory.recall("deadlines")
# Returns: ["My current project deadline is March 15th"]
```

That's it. No vector DBs to manage. No complex prompt engineering. Just a conscience that works.

## Features

- 🚀 **5-minute integration** - Drop-in memory for any LLM app
- 🔌 **Framework agnostic** - Works with LangChain, OpenAI, Anthropic, and more
- ⚡ **Fast** - Sub-200ms recall latency
- 🔒 **Secure** - Optional E2E encryption, GDPR compliant
- 📊 **Smart** - Semantic search, auto-summarization, importance ranking

## Installation

```bash
pip install agentmind
```

## Framework Integrations

### With LangChain

```python
from langchain import ConversationChain
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from agentmind.integrations.langchain import AgentMindMemory

# Use AgentMind as LangChain's memory - persists across sessions!
memory = AgentMindMemory(local_mode=True, user_id="user_123")

chain = ConversationChain(
    llm=OpenAI(),
    memory=memory
)

# First conversation
chain.predict(input="I'm working on a React app with TypeScript")
chain.predict(input="I need help with state management")

# Later session - the AI remembers!
response = chain.predict(input="What technology stack am I using?")
# Output: "You're working on a React app with TypeScript. Last time we discussed
# state management options for your project."
```

### With OpenAI

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from agentmind import Memory
from agentmind.integrations.openai import enhance_with_memory

client = OpenAI()
memory = Memory(local_mode=True, user_id="founder_1234")

# Track founder's journey and challenges
memory.remember("Building a fintech startup focused on small business lending")
memory.remember("Team of 8 people, raised $2M seed round last month")
memory.remember("Revenue goal: $1M ARR by end of year")

# Founder asks for strategic advice
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Should I hire a compliance officer or outsource SOC2?"}
]

# Automatically inject relevant context
enhanced_messages = enhance_with_memory(messages, memory)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=enhanced_messages
)
# AI response considers the startup's size (8 people), funding ($2M), and revenue goals
```

## Advanced Features

### Semantic Search
```python
# Find memories by meaning, not just keywords
memories = memory.recall(
    "technical challenges",
    strategy="semantic",
    limit=5
)
```

### Memory Management
```python
# Store complex data structures
user_profile = {
    "name": "Sarah Chen",
    "role": "Product Manager",
    "team": "Growth",
    "goals": ["Increase user retention", "Launch mobile app"],
    "last_review": "2024-01-15"
}
memory.remember(user_profile, session_id="onboarding_001")

# Organize memories with metadata
memory.remember("Q4 revenue target: $1M", metadata={
    "category": "business",
    "importance": "high",
    "expires": "2024-12-31"
}, session_id="planning_session")

# Batch operations
memories = [
    {"content": "Launched MVP", "timestamp": "2024-01-15"},
    {"content": "First customer", "timestamp": "2024-02-01"}
]
memory.remember_batch(memories, session_id="milestone_tracking")

# Forget when needed
memory.forget(memory_id="mem_abc123")
memory.forget_before(date="2023-01-01")
```

### Session Management
```python
# Auto-summarize conversations
summary = memory.summarize_session(session_id="chat_123")

# Export user data (GDPR)
data = memory.export_user_data(user_id="user_123")
```

## Deployment Options

### 🏠 Self-Hosted (Available Now)
Run AgentMind locally or on your own infrastructure. Perfect for development and testing.

```python
# Works completely offline
memory = Memory(local_mode=True)
```
